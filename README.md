# Front End Masters - Complete Intro to Web Dev Course 


## Details 

I took advantage of Github student offer of 6-month free membership to Front End Masters. 

I started with their Beginner learning path with the idea of refreshing and cementing some of the core principles and filling any gaps in knowledge that I probably have due to the intensive nature of the SoC bootcamp.

### Interesting takeaways so far:

- Spend time making code readable, understandable and maintainable. Don’t be clever.
- Holy grail is to make declarative code that doesn't need comments.
- We will spend more time maintaining code than writing code, thus we are trying to optimize for that.
- Writing code so that we can maintain it in the future. So that when we come back to it later, we can understand the system as quickly as possible, make the required changes and move on.
- Don't go overboard with comments. Be sparing with comments.
- Very important to name things well. It’s worth taking time to pause and think of a good name for something. Keeping names useful and up to date is worth the time investment.
- Semantic naming. Naming things by what they do and not by what they look like.

## Programming fundamentals - Javascript

- aim is not to be clever, but to be simple and communicate clearly. Code is communication.
- Variable names are generally nouns
- Function names are usually verbs
- be careful with using global scope. It’s a very powerful tool and we should adhere to the principal of least power
- Reference Error usually refers to as Scope error
